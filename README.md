# 💖 The DandyHacks 2023 website

This is the website for DandyHacks 2023, the 11th run of the University of
Rochester's premier hackathon. Go Yellowjackets! 🐝

## 🍽️ Tech stack

Our tech stack is optimized for the best speed:

- HTML
- TailwindCSS
- [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/)

## 🚀 Deploy

Just start a local server! e.g.

```shell
python3 -m http.server
```

## 🚧 Development

When developing the website, in addition to starting a local server like in the
above step, you also need to build TailwindCSS:

```shell
npm run tailwindcss
```

## 🌳 Branches

- `dev`: the main development branch; all code gets branched from and merged
  into this branch;
- `pre-launch`: the pre-launch upstream; once certain developments are done in
  `dev`, changes get merged into this branch. **Now defunct**;
- `final-website`: the final website upstream. Features developed in `dev` get
  merged into here.

## 🚦 Status

We have finished the pre-launch website and are now working on the final
website. Please see [the final website project][project] for task tracking.
